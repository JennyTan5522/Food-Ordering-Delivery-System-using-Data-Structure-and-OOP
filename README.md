A Food Ordering and Delivery System is designed to streamline the ordering and delivery processes for customers, restaurants, and delivery riders. 
Using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the system is divided into modular components to enhance maintenance, debugging, collaboration, and code reusability.

System Overview:
Customers: Users can browse a variety of restaurants and food choices, place orders with a few clicks, and view transparent food prices and delivery charges. Their personal details, activities, cart, and finance management are handled through dedicated modules.
Restaurants: Staff can instantly update menus based on available ingredients, avoiding shortages and oversold conditions. This ensures minimal delays and clear communication with customers. Menu and order management modules support restaurant staff in controlling the food preparation process.
Riders: Delivery riders can register with the system to earn extra income. They receive clear delivery details through a pop-up order system, ensuring efficient delivery with no communication breakdown. Rider-specific modules handle personal details, shift management, and order assignments.
